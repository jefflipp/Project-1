## GA Matching

This online game will be a version of well-known Concentration Game, customized with GA-based pictures.  This game will test players ability to uncover the matching set of pictures most efficiently.

This is a two-player game that requires concentration, focus, and performance under a highly stressful situation.  This game is **not** a game for the weak timid.

### Objective of the game

A player must complete the entire board by finding and exposing all of the pairs of matching pictures more efficiently than her competition.  The pairs will be found by clicking on the two  matching, hidden pictures sequentially.

#### Scoring

Scoring takes into account two factors:

1. Time elapsed to finish the board  
2. Number of total attempts required to complete the board
3. Bonus point opportunities exist (likely finding a match on the first or first two attempts of a player's turn). 

#### Game Board Layout

The competitors will need to decide on a grid prior to starting the game.  There will be multiiple options depending upon the level of difficulty desired.

Game Board Options will likely include:  

1. 4 x 4  
2. 6 x 6  
3. 8 x 8  
4. 10 x 10

A real-time clock will be displayed during each players turn.


### Player Game Flow

* Each player will be asked to input his/her name  
* One of the players will choose the board dimensions from the available options  
* Player 1 will click 'Start Game' and click on the available, hidden squares in order to reveal the photographs  
* Once the baord is complete, a score will be generated and placed next to Player 1's name  
* Player 2 will now proceed with the same exact steps as Player 1  

#### Winner Declaration

The game will compare the respective scores of the two Players and declare a winner.

###Preliminary Wireframe (6 x 6 is only option)

#### Other Considerations

* Speed round elements
* Flip a virtual coin to determine who goes first
* animation on a win - maybe video of twerking (new page for celebration)  
* Create and display a "Top 10" Scoring list that gets updated with new high scores that make the list and displace an existing score on the list.  Score will be associated with the player name provided at the start of the game.
* Email or text alert about placement on the High Score List.


## INTERNAL

####Immediate Next Steps:  
1. Wireframe game board
2. Make notes on all functions required to run through the game
2. Build MVP based on known coding strategies
2. Sketch out plan to upgrade code and functionality
3. Research dynamic game board based on [a x a] options
4. Research pop-up screens that are more desirbale than alert boxes
5. Research cool flipping of the cards
6. Research cards flipping back on a timer when not a match
3. Explore bootstrap and research for tie in  
4. Look at code pen for some code strategies
5. Randomizing pictures tied to start button
